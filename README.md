 Arbitrary file upload vulnerability 
File Type Check Missing:

Defective Code: $target = "upload/product/".basename($_FILES['image']['name']);
Problem Description: The code directly uses the original name of the uploaded file without checking its file type. This might allow the uploading of executable scripts, such as .php files.
